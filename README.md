# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after successfully fetching data from an API.  The issue is subtle and can be difficult to debug.

## Bug Description

The provided `bug.js` file contains a component that fetches data from a sample API endpoint. Although the data is successfully fetched and parsed, the FlatList remains empty. This is likely due to an asynchronous issue, race condition, or improper data handling. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the component that addresses the issue by carefully managing asynchronous operations and ensuring data is correctly handled within the FlatList. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the application using a React Native simulator or device.
4. Observe that the FlatList initially displays 'Loading...', then renders empty even when the API call has returned data.

## Solution Explanation

The solution uses `useEffect` hook to fetch the data and correctly updates the component state in a way that the `FlatList` can reliably access and render the data.
